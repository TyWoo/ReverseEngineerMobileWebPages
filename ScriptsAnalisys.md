# Observations

- The javascript scripts must be located before the `</body>` tag this improves the page speeed loading.
- The javascript scripts must have the type `<script type="text/javascript">` tag.
- To avoid render blocking the javascript must have the [async or defer](https://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html) when it's possible.
- There must be 1 call to `ready` function of jquery this optimize the code and doesn't make to many calls to this function.
- Put all the `<script type="text/javascript"></script>` in one.
- The css code must be located on the head tag `<head></head>`.
